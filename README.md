# pw
convenient command for generating 9 digit password

## How to Use

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kangkyu/pw.git
cd pw
go build
```

It will generate `pw` executable,
then move the `pw` file to your running programs folder (for example, `/usr/local/bin/`)

or something like this, you know ;-)

```
ln -s $(pwd)/pw /usr/local/bin/pw
```
